Men made more purchases the Women at a ratio of greater than 4:1
The most popular purchasers(and assumed players) is the very expected demographics of people between ages 15-24
Most likely because of the larger number of purchases made by men, but I was surprised that the difference in average price of purchases between men and women/other was >= $.40
And in that same vein the most popular purchases were some of the more expensive(surprising to me, but good pricing strategy by Heroes of Pymoli)
